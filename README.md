Hadoop for HPCers
=====================

A quick Introduction to Hadoop for those from an HPC simulation
background.  Class should take 3-4 hours. Briefly introduces

* HDFS
* Mapreduce
* Pig
* Spark.

A PDF of the presentation, and shortly a Markdown version, can be found in the 
presentation directory; all examples can be found under examples.  The course 
VMs can be built with the Vagrantfiles under vm-cfg; there's a headless one for
text-only and a larger GUI/Desktop one.
